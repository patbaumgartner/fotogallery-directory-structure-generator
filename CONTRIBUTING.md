## Code of Conduct

This project follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to uphold it.

## How to Report a Bug

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue with the **Bug report** template.
3. Include:
   - A clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce the problem
   - Expected vs. actual behaviour
   - Java version, OS, and the CSV file structure used

## How to Suggest a Feature

1. **Search existing issues** to see if the idea has already been discussed.
2. Open a new issue with the **Feature request** template.
3. Describe the use case and why it would be valuable.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** (Temurin distribution recommended)
- **Maven** (or use the included `./mvnw` wrapper)

### Build

```bash
# Build JAR (skip tests)
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

# Run all tests
./mvnw test
```

## Making a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
   ```
2. Make your changes and **add tests** where appropriate.
3. Run the full test suite:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw verify
   ```
4. Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`.
5. Fill in the pull request template and describe *what* and *why*.

PRs are reviewed promptly. Please be patient if feedback takes a day or two.

## Coding Standards

- Follow standard Java conventions and the existing code style.
- Keep services stateless and use constructor injection.
- Do not add REST endpoints — this is a CLI tool only.
